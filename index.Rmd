# Purpose

### The purpose of this study is to explore:

--

* what supports for professional learning ECEs seek during induction, if any; 

--

* from whom; and 

--

* how, if at all, they use social media with the intention of seeking supports and connections.

# Research Questions

```{r, out.width = "360", echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}
include_graphics("img/question.jpg")
```

--

* RQ1. What **supports for professional learning**, if any, are ECEs seeking during induction?

--

* RQ2. What **reasons**, if any, do ECEs report for seeking induction supports, and what reasons do they give, if any, for not seeking induction supports?

--

* RQ3. What **interpersonal connections** do ECEs make when seeking supports for professional learning during induction?

--

* RQ4. How, if at all, do ECEs use **social media** as a modality to access supports for professional learning during induction?

# Overview of Methods

### Exploratory Sequential Mixed Methods

```{r, out.width = "720", echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}
include_graphics("img/method-overview.png")
```

--

* *Stage 1*: Qualitative interviews to explore

--

* *Stage 2*: Quantitative surveys to generalize

--

* *Stage 3*: Interpretation

---

# Stage 1: Qualitative Interviews

```{r, out.width = "480", echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}
include_graphics("img/interview.jpg")
```

--

* Participants: #MAET students, 0-3 years experience, in U.S.

--

* Pilot study: publicity email, interview protocol

--

* Data collection: semi-structured interviews to saturation

--

* Data analysis: transcribe, thematic analysis, eclectic coding, IRR

---

# Stage 2: Quantitative Surveys

```{r, out.width = "480", echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}
include_graphics("img/survey.jpg")
```

--

* Participants: far and wide, 0-3 years experience, in U.S.

--

* Pilot study: construct survey instrument, test internal reliability
--

* Data collection: ask colleagues to spread word, Twitter

--

* Data analysis: descriptive statistics

---

# Stage 3: Interpretation

```{r, out.width = "480", echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}
include_graphics("img/generalize.jpg")
```

--

* Not about comparing qualitative findings to quantitative

--

* Discussing which qualitative findings seem to be generalizable

I will explore:
* what supports for professional learning ECEs seek during induction, if any; 
* from whom; and 
* how, if at all, they use social media with the intention of seeking supports and connections.
